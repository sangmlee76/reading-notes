# Read 08 - Notes: Javascript operators and loops

## What makes a computer a computer?
+ Takes input
+ Stores data
+ Processes data
+ Provides output

## How computers work: binary and data
- Computers use binary number system
- Binary system (1/0, T/F, on/off) is to used to control circuits
- Using this system all input data is converted to a numeric system which is then translated for the computer to use (ex. 8 wires can store 255 numbers).
   + text - converted to numbers using a pre-defined number system
   + images/videos - uses pixels that have number based system (e.g. rgb)
   + sound - uses wave forms and series of numbers that are associated with them.

## Circuits and logic
- combination of circuits and logic gates perform insane amount of calculations
- An **adder** is an example of a circuit + logic gate combination that allows computers to add numbers (using binary) very quickly and accurately.

## CPU, memory, I/O
- Input: keyboard, camera, sensors, etc.
- Output: monitor, speaker, 3-D printer, etc.
- Both CPU and Memory work in concert to process and store data in a loop in order to take input and produce output.

## Hardware and software
- Software uses hardware to execute the 4 core functions (input, store, process, output) of a computer.
- An operating system is a master software that manages other softwares on a computer.
