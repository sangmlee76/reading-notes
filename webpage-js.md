# Read 06a - Notes: Dynamic web pages with Javascript

### Webpage framework

1. Content layer (.html):
    + Holds the content of the webpage
    + Gives page structure and adds semantic
2. Presentation layer (.css):
    + Uses rules that state how the HTML conent is presented
3. Behavior layer (.js):
    + Control how the page behaves, by adding interactivity


**Note:** *Where possible, keep each language in its own file (and directory), then use `<link>` to connect them together.  More specifically, use `<link>` in HTML file to bring in the .css or .js code.*
