## Choosing a text editor
A **text editor** is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.

#### Key features of a text editor, which varies by each developer, identified in the article are as follows:
- **Code completion:** It allows you to start typing, and the code completion feature will display possible suggestions based on what you originally typed.
- **Syntax highlighting:** By using different colored texts based on what the text represents. For example, attributes are a different color than elements. This aids in debugging code by making it easier to read.
- **Variety of themes:** Can adjust background to darker color theme to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
- **Healthy selection of extensions:** Extensions are like plugins for your text editor.

#### Default text editors
**MacOS:** Text Edit 
**Windows:** Notepad

#### Text editors vs IDEs
An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. Sample list of [Best Integrated Development Environments](https://www.g2.com/categories/integrated-development-environments-ide).

## Command Line (CL)
The **command line** is the prompt on a terminal to execute commands.

#### Key Concepts
+ **Relative path:** A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
+ **Absolute path:** A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
+ **Everything is a file under Linux:** This includes directories.
+ **Linux is an extensionless system:** Files can have any extension or none at all.
+ **Linux is case sensitive:** Beware of silly typos.

#### CL Cheatsheet
`up/down arrow` (at command line): traverses recent history of commands.

`pwd`: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.

`ls`: List the contents of a directory.

`cd`: "Change Directories" - ie. move to another directory. If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home 
directory.

`file`: provides information on the file or directory type.

`mkdir`: "Make Direcotry" - creates a new subdirectory within the current directory 

`-l`: indicates a long listing (e.g. ls -1)

`-a`: lists all files, including hidden files (e.g. ls -a)

`~` (tilde): shortcut for your home directory.

`.` (dot): reference to your current directory.

`..` (dotdot): reference to the parent directory.


**tab completion:** hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto complete action.
**for compound word file names (has space(s) in name):** use escape () or quotes ('') to avoid errors (e.g. cd 'Holiday Photos' or cd Holiday\ Photos).
