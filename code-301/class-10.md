# Read 10 - Notes: The Call Stack and Debugging

## [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)
+ Javascript engine:
  - found in a hosting environment like the browser
  - single threaded interpreter with a heap and a single stack
  - browser provides web APIs such as DOM, AJAX, and Timers

+ The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call) and is synchronous.

+ In asynchronous Javascript,the callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

+ The call stack manages function invocation.

+ A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive without an exit point.

+ Works as a LIFO data structure.
