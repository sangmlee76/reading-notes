+ (T/F) Some research indicates that pair programming is slightly faster and produces higher-quality code.

+ (T/F) Some research identified that pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and workplace enjoyment

+ (T/F) Pairing creates a less engaging experirence compared to working alone becaue two programmers tend to side-track each other (e.g. Facebook, web-surfing)

+ (T/F) Pair programming boosts overall confidence of both programmers involved in it.

+ (T/F) Pair programmers should only be assigned if they have equal skill level in order to optimize learning.

+ (T/F) Pair programming often create social tensions because people fundamentally have different personalities; this often leads to programmers debating who should drive.

+ (T/F) Communication skills are far less important than technical skills; therefore, pair programming should be used to exclusively hone technical skills

+ (T/F) Once you leave Code Fellows, you will never see pair programming again. So, just suck it up and endure it for the time being.
