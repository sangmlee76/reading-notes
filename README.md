## 2. Growth Mindset
As Lao Tzu said:
>*The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.*

#### In my own words
Growth mindset is a frame of tackling new challenges (e.g. unknowns and uncertainties). It allows one to think about how to overcome difficult and uncertain tasks across different domains (e.g. learning, relationships, etc.). Specifically, it teaches that by using the framework of growth, one is able to stay more open minded and have a long-term view that better faciliate one's ability to overcome new, difficult challenges/tasks for which one may not yet be prepared.

#### I plan to use the following reminders (using a daily journal):
```
+ Daily goal: framed as time spent to tackle the challenge, not 'what got done/solved'.
+ Daily reflection: review progress made each day (double down on things that worked and modify things that didn't)
+ Make it fun: think of it as a game to focus, challenge, and celebrate
```
